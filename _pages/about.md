Prior to Teachers College, I attended the University of California at Davis and earned my B.S. in Applied Mathematics. As a first-generation college student, I am honored share my passion of mathematics with the next generation. I also obtained a Master of Engineering degree in Operations Research at Cornell University - Cornell Tech NYC campus.

I firmly believe that mathematics is the great equalizer and the gateway to ALL high-paying STEM fields. What I mean by the great equalizer is that no matter what your background is, learning mathematics is key to advancing upwards in our society. The more you put in, the more rewards you will receive. Understanding math opens doors to numerous opportunities in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. These fields are at the forefront of innovation and offer some of the most rewarding careers both intellectually and financially.

I am honored to have the privilege to sharing my love of mathematics with you and invite you on this fantastic journey ðŸŒŸ.
