## About Me

Prior to Teachers College, I attended the University of California at Davis and earned my B.S. in Applied Mathematics. 
<br><br>
I firmly believe that mathematics is the great equalizer and the gateway to ALL high-paying STEM fields. What I mean by the great equalizer is that no matter what your background is, learning mathematics is key to advancing upwards in our society. The more you put in, the more rewards you will receive. Understanding math opens doors to numerous opportunities in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. These fields are at the forefront of innovation and offer some of the most rewarding careers both intellectually and financially.
<br><br>
Teaching mathematics is one of my greatest passions. I find immense joy in not only sharing knowledge but also in inspiring curiosity and excitement in my students. Mathematics is more than formulas and calculationsâ€”itâ€™s a language of patterns, problem-solving, and discovery. I love showing students how math connects to the world around them, uncovering its beauty and relevance in everyday life.

I am honored to have the privilege to sharing my love of mathematics with you.
