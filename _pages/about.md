</div>

Prior to Teachers College, I attended the University of California at Davis and earned my B.S. in Applied Mathematics. 
<br><br>
I am seeking full-time Lecturer or Instructor positions in community college and teaching-focused higher education settings. My preparation combines rigorous mathematical thinking with evidence-based instructional practices designed to support student access, retention, and success.
<br><br>
I firmly believe that mathematics is the great equalizer and the gateway to ALL high-paying STEM fields. What I mean by the great equalizer is that no matter what your background is, learning mathematics is key to advancing upwards in our society. The more you put in, the more rewards you will receive. Understanding math opens doors to numerous opportunities in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. These fields are at the forefront of innovation and offer some of the most rewarding careers both intellectually and financially.
<br><br>
My teaching philosophy centers on making mathematics accessible without lowering standards, helping students develop confidence, persistence, and a sense of belonging in mathematics--particularly in gateway and foundational courses.
<br><br>
Teaching mathematics is one of my greatest passions. I find immense joy in not only sharing knowledge but also in inspiring curiosity and excitement in my students. Mathematics is more than formulas and calculations—it’s a language of patterns, problem-solving, and discovery. I love showing students how math connects to the world around them, uncovering its beauty and relevance in everyday life.
<br><br>
I view mathematics as more than a collection of procedures; it is a language of structure, reasoning, and problem-solving the connects directly to the world students live in. In my classrooms, I emphasize clarity, active engagement, and high expectations while supporting students with varied academic preparation.
<br><br>
I am especially interested in serving at access-oriented institutions where teaching excellence and student access are core priorities. As a Lecturer or Instructor, I aim to contribute through high-quality instruction, collaboration with colleagues, and long-term departmental service
<br><br>
I am honored to have the privilege to sharing my love of mathematics with you!!
